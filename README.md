MakerFarm-i3-Prusa-Captive-Nuts
===============================

The MakerFarm i3 comes with a bed leveling kit. But the heat bed leveling was still a pain in the neck as it required two hands to hold a wrench and allen for the adjustments. And there is not that much room to work. If the kit used captive nuts it would be so much easier to adjust with one hand. So I printed some corner brackets to hold the lock nuts.
